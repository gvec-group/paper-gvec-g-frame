abstract = {The first stellarator design was a simple tube of plasma twisted and closed on itself in the form of a figure-8. The line of such devices, however, was quickly ended over concerns related to plasma stability. We revisit the figure-8 concept, re-imagined as a modern optimized stellarator, and find the potential for a high degree of stability, as well as exceptionally simple construction. In particular, the design that we find admits planar coils, and is the first quasi-isodynamic stellarator design to have this property. Our work is made possible by recent theoretical progress in the near-axis theory of quasi-isodynamic stellarators, combined with fundamental progress in the numerical solution of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibria that cannot be well represented using traditional cylindrical coordinates.}

	abstract = {A new approach for constructing polar-like boundary-conforming coordinates inside a toroid with strongly shaped cross-sections is presented. A coordinate mapping is obtained through a variational approach, which involves identifying extremal points of a proposed action in the mapping space from [0, 2\{{\textbackslash}pi\}] x [0, 2\{{\textbackslash}pi\}] x [0, 1] to a toroidal domain in R3. This approach employs an action built on the squared Jacobian and radial length. Extensive testing is conducted on general toroidal boundaries using a global Fourier-Zernike basis via action minimization. The results demonstrate successful coordinate construction capable of accurately describing strongly shaped toroidal domains. The coordinate construction is successfully applied to the computation of 3D MHD equilibria in the GVEC code where the use of traditional coordinate construction by interpolation from the boundary failed.},

abstract = {Due to its minimal twist, the rotation minimizing frame (RMF) is widely used in computer graphics, including sweep or blending surface modeling, motion design and control in computer animation and robotics, streamline visualization, and tool path planning in CAD/CAM. We present a novel simple and efficient method for accurate and stable computation of RMF of a curve in 3D. This method, called the double reflection method, uses two reflections to compute each frame from its preceding one to yield a sequence of frames to approximate an exact RMF. The double reflection method has the fourth order global approximation error, thus it is much more accurate than the two currently prevailing methods with the second order approximation error—the projection method by Klok and the rotation method by Bloomenthal, while all these methods have nearly the same per-frame computational cost. Furthermore, the double reflection method is much simpler and faster than using the standard fourth order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the defining ODE of the RMF, though they have the same accuracy. We also investigate further properties and extensions of the double reflection method, and discuss the variational principles in design moving frames with boundary conditions, based on RMF.},

	abstract = {A method is demonstrated to rapidly calculate the shapes and properties of quasi-axisymmetric and quasi-helically symmetric stellarators. In this approach, optimization is applied to the equations of magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and quasisymmetry, expanded in the small distance from the magnetic axis, as formulated by Garren \& Boozer [Phys. Fluids B, vol. 3, 1991, p. 2805]. Due to the reduction of the equations by the expansion, the computational cost is significantly reduced, to times of the order of 1 cpu second, enabling wide and high-resolution scans over parameter space. In contrast to traditional stellarator optimization, here, the cost function serves to maximize the volume in which the expansion is accurate. A key term in the cost function is ‖∇B‖∥∇B∥{\textbackslash}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}boldsymbol \{{\textbackslash}nabla \}{\textbackslash}boldsymbol B {\textbackslash}{\textbar}, the norm of the magnetic field gradient, to maximize scale lengths in the field. Using this method, a database of 5×1055×1055{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5 optimized configurations is calculated and presented. Quasisymmetric configurations are observed to exist in continuous bands, varying in the ratio of the magnetic axis length to average major radius. Several qualitatively new types of configuration are found, including quasi-helically symmetric fields in which the number of field periods is two or more than six.},

The approach directly solves the equilibrium force balance as a system of nonlinear equations in the form f(x)=0. The independent variables x represent nested magnetic flux surfaces expressed in the inverse representation with toroidal flux coordinates, and the equations f(x) quantify equilibrium force balance errors at discrete points in real space. Discretizing with global Fourier–Zernike basis functions properly treats the magnetic axis and minimizes the number of coefficients needed to describe the flux surfaces. The pseudospectral method provides great flexibility in where the errors are evaluated, and the system of equations is efficiently solved with a Newton–Raphson iteration. Equilibria are computed and compared against VMEC for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric examples. The results show fast convergence rates and solutions with low errors throughout the plasma volume.},

  abstract={In this work we study first the most general toroidal equilibria in the neighbourhood of a magnetic axis, characteristic line in toroidal topology. For this purpose we use a system of tri-orthogonal coordinates tied to the magnetic axis, which is defined with the help of its own intrinsic co-ordinates: R(s) and T(s) . The results of the equilibrium calculations show that all other things being equal, no further equilibrium is possible in general when the angle ι c 0 of rotational transformation on the magnetic axis approaches a whole multiple of 2π. We give the developments of the physical quantities at equilibrium as far as the third order. We deduce from these properties a classification of toroidal equilibria, and some examples are treated. In the second part we study the stability of these equilibria in terms of localized displacements. The results indicate some regions of stabilities for configurations characterized by ι 0c /2π≈ k : A simple example of a straight stellarator is treated and furnished with conditions for equilibrium and stability characterized by some β c ' s of equilibrium and stability.}
